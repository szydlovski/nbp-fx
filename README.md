# nbp-fx

A small wrapper for the National Bank of Poland's currency exchange rates API.

# Usage

```
npm install nbp-fx
```

```javascript
const { rates } = require('nbp-fx');

(async () => {
  
  // get fx rate for a specific date
  // accepts dates and date strings
  await rates.getRateForDate('EUR', '2020-11-23') // 4.468
  await rates.getRateForDate('EUR', new Date(2020, 10, 23)) // 4.468

  // get latest fx rate
  // currency codes are case insensititve
  await rates.getCurrentRate('USD') // 3.663
  await rates.getCurrentRate('usd') // 3.663
  await rates.getCurrentRate('uSd') // 3.663
  
  // get last 10 fx rates
  await rates.getLastRates('CHF', 10) // (10) [..., { rate: 4.1362, date:... }, ...]

  // get fx rates in range
  await rates.getRatesBetweenDates('RUB', ['2019-02-13', '2019-06-22']) // (89) [...]

  // weekends and public holidays get automatically adjusted backwards to the nearest working day
  const rateOnSunday = await rates.getRateForDate('USD', '2020-12-06')
  const rateOnFriday = await rates.getRateForDate('USD', '2020-12-04')
  rateOnSunday === rateOnFriday /// true

});
```

# Arguments

## `date`

Valid `Date` object or valid ISO8601 date `string`. `FXNBPDateError` will be thrown otherwise.

## `dateRange = [startDate, endDate]`

`Array` containing two [`dates`](#date), respectively the `startDate` and `endDate` of the date range. The dates may not be set in the future, `endDate` may not be set earlier than `startDate`, and the range may not cover more than 367 days (limit of the NBP API). `FXNBPDateError` will be thrown otherwise.

## `amountOfRecords`

Positive non-zero integer `number`, smaller or equal to 255 (limit of the NBP API). `FXNBPError` will be thrown otherwise.

## `currencyCode`

Accepts a `string` containing a three letter ISO4217 currency code, case insensitive. `FXNBPError` will be thrown if the currency is not supported.

# Module

## `fxNbp.canRequestRatesForDate(date)`

Arguments: [`date`](#date)

Returns `true` if rates can be requested for the provided date (that is, if it was a working day in Poland - not a Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday), and `false` if they can not.

Throws: `FXNBPDateError` if the provided date is not valid.

## `fxNbp.isCurrencySupported(currencyCode)`

Arguments: [`currencyCode`](#currencyCode)

Returns: `true` if the currency is supported, `false` if it is not.

## `fxNbp.getSupportedCurrencies()`

Arguments: *none*

Returns: `Array` of `strings` containing three letter ISO4217 currency codes of all currencies supported by the library.

# Rates

## `fxNbp.rates.getCurrentRate(currencyCode)`

Arguments: [`currencyCode`](#currencyCode)

Returns: floating point `number` representing the latest exchange rate for the requested currency.

## `fxNbp.rates.getRateForDate(currencyCode, date[, adjustDate = true])`

Arguments: [`currencyCode`](#currencyCode), [`date`](#date), `boolean` `adjustDate`

Returns: floating point `number` representing the exchange rate for the requested currency on the reqested date. If `adjustDate` is `true`, the date may be changed - see [date adjustment](#date-adjustment).

Throws: `FXNBPDateError` if `adjustDate` is false and the requested date was not a working day in Poland

## `fxNbp.rates.getLastRates(currencyCode[, amountOfRecords = 10])`

Arguments: [`currencyCode`](#currencyCode), [`amountOfRecords`](#amountOfRecords)

Returns: `Array` with length equal to `amountOfRecords` (defaults to `10`), containing a number of latest exchange rate records for the requested currency. Records are returned as plain objects, containing two self explanatory properties - `rate` and `date`.

## `fxNbp.rates.getRatesBetweenDates(currencyCode, dateRange)`

Arguments: [`currencyCode`](#currencyCode), [`dateRange`](#daterange--startdate-enddate)

Returns: `Array` containing a number of exchange rate records for the requested currency, in the requested range of dates. Records are returned as plain objects with the same properties as the objects returned by [getLastRates](#fxnbpratesgetlastrates).

# Tables

## `fxNbp.tables.getCurrentTable()`

Arguments: *none*

Returns: `Object` representing the latest "A" table of exchange rates, with the following properties:
- `number` - `string` - containing the official identification number of the table, i.e. `"237/A/NBP/2020"`
- `date` - `Date` - set to the day when the table was published
- `rates` - `Array -` of plain objects containing two self explanatory properties - `rate` and `code`.

## `fxNbp.tables.getTableForDate(date[, adjustDate = true])`

Arguments: [`date`](#date), `boolean` `adjustDate`

Returns: `Object` representing the "A" table of exchange rates on the requested date, containing the same properties as the object returned by [`getCurrentTable`](#fxNbp.tables.getCurrentTable()). If `adjustDate` is false the date may be changed the same way as in [`getRateForDate`](#fxnbpratesgetratefordate) - see [date adjustment](#date-adjustment).

Throws: `FXNBPDateError` if `adjustDate` is false and the requested date was not a working day in Poland

## `fxNbp.tables.getLastTables([amountOfRecords = 10])`

Arguments: [`amountOfRecords`](#amountOfRecords)

Returns: `Array` with length equal to `amountOfRecords` (defaults to `10`), containing a number of `Objects` representing latest "A" tables of exchange rates, with the same properties as the object returned by [`getCurrentTable`](#fxNbp.tables.getCurrentTable()).

## `fxNbp.tables.getTablesBetweenDates(dateRange)`

Arguments: [`dateRange`](#daterange--startdate-enddate)

Returns: `Array` containing a number of `Objects` representing "A" tables of exchange rates in the requested range of dates, with the same properties as the object returned by [`getCurrentTable`](#fxNbp.tables.getCurrentTable()).

# Notes on the NBP API

The National Bank of Poland publishes three types of exchange rate tables:
- "A" tables are published on every working day and contain average exchange rates for a selection of 35 popular foreign currencies
- "B" tables are published on every Wednesday that is a working day, and otherwise on the previous day, and contain average exchange rates for 115 less popular foreign currencies
- "C" tables are published on every working day and contain average buy and sell rates for a selection of 35 popular foreign currencies

If data is requested for a date on which no table was published (for example, "A" table rates on a Sunday, or "B" table rates on a Thursday), the NBP API will unceremoniously throw up a 404.

This library currently only supports "A" tables and validates the provided dates to make sure the call is valid (i.e. asking for rates published on a working day).

## Date adjustment

Functions that accept a date as an argument will automatically adjust the date backwards to the nearest date for which an "A" table is available, returning the rate that was binding on the originally requested date.

## Supported currencies

THB, USD, AUD, HKD, CAD, NZD, SGD, EUR, HUF, CHF, GBP, UAH, JPY, CZK, DKK, ISK, NOK, SEK, HRK, RON, BGN, TRY, ILS, CLP, PHP, MXN, ZAR, BRL, MYR, RUB, IDR, INR, KRW, CNY, XDR
